To ensure consistency, all commits to the main XSON repo or its wiki must have messages, and said messages must follow these guidelines:

- The first line should give a very brief description. This first line is required.
- Any extra or detailed information is optional but should be in a seperate paragraph.
- They must start with a first person singular present tense verb (e.g. Add, Update, Reorganize, Change).
