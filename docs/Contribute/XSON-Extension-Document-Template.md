> Note that dashes and colons in the file names of extension documents that are meant to be displayed in the title of the wiki page are different characters that look the same: 
> `U+A789` for colon and `U+2010` for dash (`꞉` and `‐`). 
> This is so they render properly as titles in the wiki while also being safe for different filesystems.
